The more people are employed, the more likely they are to be using money to purchase their needs and wants. As more people purchase goods, the likelihood that employment will also rise, as stores hire people and purchase goods themselves to meet demand will.

This will mean that businesses and producers may have to cut their workforce which  leads to more unemployment.
