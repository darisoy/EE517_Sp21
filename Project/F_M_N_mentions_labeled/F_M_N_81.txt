See video: 27TV at  This video shows how this experiment can be used as a clock with the concentration chosen so that the experiment changes colour at a specific time (or with a particular part of a song). This is why this experiment is known as the iodine clock reaction. See video: 27TW at  Exercise 7 3: Rates of reaction 1. Hydrochloric acid and calcium carbonate react according to the following equation: CaCO3(s) + 2HCl(f) CaCl2(s) + H2O(f) + CO2(g) The volume of carbon dioxide that is produced during the reaction is measured at different times. The results are shown in the table below.
