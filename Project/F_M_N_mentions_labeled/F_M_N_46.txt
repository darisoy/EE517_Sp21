The town also had a town common, or green, which was basically a large, open space in the center of town where people could meet and cattle and sheep could graze. One of the most important places in town was the meeting house. Here, people would meet to discuss town business. They would also use the building as a site for their church. As you learned in previous chapters, religion was very important to the colonists, so the place they met for church was very important to them.
