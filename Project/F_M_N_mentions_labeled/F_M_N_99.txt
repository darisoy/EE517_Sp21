The Reading Frame The reading frame is the frame of three bases in which the mRNA is read or translated. Every sequence can be read in three reading frames, each of which will produce a different amino acid sequence. For example, in the sequence GCAUGGGGGUCUAG, the reading frame can begin with either the first G, the first C, or the first A. As stated above, translation starts with the start codon which consists of the three bases AUG. Each subsequent codon is translated until an in-frame stop codon is reached. In the example above, the polypeptide sequence would be: methionine glycine valine stop. Mutations that disrupt the reading frame by insertions or deletions of a non-multiple of 3 nucleotide bases are known as frameshift mutations. Take the example: THE BIG FAT CAT ATE THE RED RAT A deletion mutation that disrupts the reading frame, results in a message that does not make any sense. If the 'B' is deleted: THE IGF ATC ATA TET HER EDR AT Once the reading frame is disrupted, the mRNA may not be translated properly. These mutations may impair the function of the resulting protein, if the protein is even formed. Many frameshift mutations result in a premature stop codon, in other words, a stop codon that come earlier than normal during translation. This would result in a smaller protein, most likely without normal function.
