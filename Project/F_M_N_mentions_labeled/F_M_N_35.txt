Colligative Properties Any solute will lower the freezing point and raise the boiling point of any solvent. The greater the concentration of the solute the lower the freezing point and greater the boiling point. You may have seen the trucks put salt on the roads when snow or ice is forecast. Why do they do that? When planes fly in cold weather, the planes need to be de-iced before liftoff. How is that done? It turns out that pure solvents differ from solutions in their boiling points and freezing points when a solute is added. In this lesson, you will understand why these events occur. Boiling and freezing point changes are both examples of colligative properties (properties of solutions that are due only to the number of particles in solution and not to the chemical properties of the solute).
