The attractive force between these oppositely charged ions is called an ionic bond. However, chemical bonding does not require the complete transfer of electrons from one atom to another. When a bond forms between two nonmetallic atoms, neither has a low enough electronegativity to completely give up an electron to its partner. Instead, the atoms overlap their orbitals, and the electrons residing in these shared orbitals can be considered to be in the valence shells of both atoms at the same time. These atoms are now in a covalent bond, held together by the attraction of both nuclei to the shared electrons.
