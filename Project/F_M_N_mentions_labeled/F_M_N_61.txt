The Importance of a Business Cycle A business cycle is a period of macroeconomic expansion followed by a period of macroeconomic contraction. These are also known by economists as fluctuations in the market. These fluctuations occur around a long-term growth trend, and typically involve shifts over time between periods of relatively rapid economic growth (expansion or boom), and periods of relative stagnation or decline (contraction or recession). These fluctuations are often measured using the growth rate of real gross domestic product. Despite being termed cycles, most of these fluctuations in economic activity do not follow a mechanical or predictable periodic pattern. It is through the phases of a business cycle and the recognition of a specific phase, that economists try to predict how the economy will perform in the future. See the graph on the next page for a visual representation of a business cycle.
