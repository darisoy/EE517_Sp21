1 Metals Examples of metals include copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), gold (Au) and silver (Ag). On the Periodic Table, the metals are on the left of the zig-zag line. There are a large number of elements that are metals. The following are some of the properties of metals: Thermal conductors Metals are good conductors of heat and are therefore used in cooking utensils such as pots and pans. Electrical conductors Metals are good conductors of electricity, and are therefore used in electrical conducting wires. Shiny metallic lustre Metals have a characteristic shiny appearance and are often used to make jewellery. Malleable This means that they can be bent into shape without breaking. Ductile Metals can stretched into thin wires such as copper, which can then be used to conduct electricity. Melting point Metals usually have a high melting point and can therefore be used to make cooking pots and other equipment that needs to become very hot, without being damaged.
