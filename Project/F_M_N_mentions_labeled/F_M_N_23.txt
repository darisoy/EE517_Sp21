Today, we have satellites with many different types of instruments that orbit the Earth. With these satellites, satellites can see hurricanes form at sea. They can follow hurricanes as they move from far out in the oceans to shore. Weather forecasters can warn people who live along the coasts. These advanced warning give people time to prepare for the storm. They can find a safe place or even evacuate the area, which helps save lives.
