Our Earth is a closed system. This means that it can exchange energy with its surroundings ( the rest of the solar system), but no new matter is brought into the system.

In the next two sections, we are going to take a closer look at two cycles that are very important for life on Earth. They are the water cycle and the nitrogen cycle.
