We are on the Earth. Let us imagine we are at the point where you see the red "X" on the orange: The Sun shines on the Earth and so we, at X, see the Sun. We call that daytime. But the Earth never stops spinning. So we, at X, move around into the shaded part of the Earth. Then we cannot see the Sun any longer and it is nighttime for us at X. The Earth spins right around in Aa hours, so it will take Aa hours for us to come around to the same position you see in the picture. We call the Aa hours a day. When we say "a day" we really mean a day and night; together they last Aa hours.
