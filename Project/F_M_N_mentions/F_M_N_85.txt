Density can be used to separate different liquids, with the more dense liquid settling to the bottom of the container, while the less dense liquid floats on top. If you throw a leaf into a river or pond the leaf will float. If you instead throw a rock (with the same surface area and volume) into the river or pond the rock will sink. This is due to the different densities of the two substances: rocks are more dense than water while leaves are less dense than water.
