3 0 x 0 1 2 3 4 5 0 1 2 3 4 5 In the case where you have to find the resultant of more than two vectors first apply the tail-to-head method to all the vectors parallel to the one axis and then all the vectors parallel to the other axis. For example, you would first calculate R-y from all the vectors parallel to the y-axis and then R-x from all the vectors parallel to the x-axis. After that you apply the same procedure as in the previous worked example to the get the final resultant.
