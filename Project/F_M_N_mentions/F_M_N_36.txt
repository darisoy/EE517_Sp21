Depending on the types of plants you are growing, and the growth stage they are in, you may need to use a fertiliser with a slightly different ratio. For example, if you want to encourage root growth in your plant you might choose a fertiliser with a greater ratio of phosphorus in it. The main functions of each nutrient (N, P, K) are given in Table 14 Remember to refer to Tables 14 and 14 as well.
