Let's look at an everyday example of static electricity. Sometimes when you comb your hair with a plastic comb your hair stands on end and makes crackling sounds. How does this happen? You have dragged the surface of the plastic comb against the surfaces of your hair. When two surfaces are rubbed together there is friction between them. Friction is a resistance against the movement of an object as a result of its contact with another object. This means that when you rubbed the plastic comb along your hair, your hair resisted the movement of the comb and slowed it down. The friction between two surfaces can cause electrons to be transferred from one surface to the other. In order to understand how electrons can be transferred, we need to remember what we learnt about the structure of an atom last term in Matter and Materials.
