EM 1 = EM 2 EP 1 + EK1 = EP 2 + EK2 mgh + 1 mv2 = mgh + 1 mv2 (1 kg)(9, 8 m s1)(2 m) + 0 = 0 + (1 kg)(v2) 19, 6 = 1 (v2) v2 = 39, 2m2 s2 v = 6, 26 m s1 The suitcase will strike the ground with a velocity of 6, 26 m s1. From this we see that when an object is lifted, like the suitcase in our example, it gains potential energy. As it falls back to the ground, it will lose this potential energy, but gain kinetic energy. We know that energy cannot be created or destroyed, but only changed from one form into another. In our example, the potential energy that the suitcase loses is changed to kinetic energy. The suitcase will have maximum potential energy at the top of the cupboard and maximum kinetic energy at the bottom of the cupboard. Halfway down it will have half kinetic energy and half potential energy. As it moves down, the potential energy will be converted (changed) into kinetic energy until all the potential energy is gone and only kinetic energy is left. The 19, 6 J of potential energy at the top will become 19, 6 J of kinetic energy at the bottom.
