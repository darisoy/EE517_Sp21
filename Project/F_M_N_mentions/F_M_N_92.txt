When muscle fibres contract these filaments slide across each other. The actin filaments shorten, but the length of the myosin filaments do not change. This causes the sarcomeres to shorten, resulting in the shortening of the whole muscle. The contraction of the muscle fibres requires energy in the form of ATP. The energy is supplied by the process of cellular respiration.
