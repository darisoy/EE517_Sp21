Arctic and Subarctic Biomes Artic and subarctic biomes are found near the north and south poles or at high altitudes in other climate zones. The biomes include tundra and boreal forests. Both have cold, dry climates and poor soil. They can support only limited plant growth and have low biodiversity.
