Motion at Constant Velocity ESAHC Motion at a constant velocity or uniform motion means that the position of the object is changing at the same rate. Assume that Vivian takes 100 s to walk the 100 m to the taxi-stop every morning. If we assume that Vivian's house is the origin and the direction to the taxi is positive, then Vivian's velocity is: = x f xi tf ti = 1 00 m 0 m 100 s 0 s = 1 m s1 Vivian's velocity is 1 m s1. This means that she walked 1 m in the first second, another metre in the second second, and another in the third second, and so on. For example, after 50 s she will be 50 m from home. Her position increases by 1 m every 1 s. A diagram of Vivian's position is shown below: t = 0 s t = 50 s t = 100 s x = 0 m x = 50 m x = 100 m We can now draw graphs of position  (-x vs. t), velocity vs. time (-v vs. t) and acceleration  (-a vs. t) for Vivian moving at a constant velocity. The graphs are shown here: 100 2 2 0 20 40 60 80 100 time t (s) 0 20 40 60 80 100 time t (s) 0 20 40 60 80 100 time t (s) Graphs for motion at constant velocity (a) position vs. time (b) velocity vs. time (c) acceleration vs. time. The area of the shaded portion in the v vs. t graph corresponds to the object's displacement. In the evening Vivian walks 100 m from the bus stop to her house in 100 s. Assume that Vivian's house is the origin. The following graphs can be drawn to describe the motion.
