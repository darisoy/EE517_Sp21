Indigenous people means the first people in a place. They have special ties and rights to the place. In the United States sometimes these people are called American Indians or Native Americans. They did not use calendars or clocks to tell time like many people do now. Instead, they relied on their natural environment. They knew their environment really well because they learned about it from their ancestors. Ancestors are family members from long, long ago. Knowing about plants and animals helped Indigenous people tell time. They knew how the animals acted during different parts of the day and year. They also knew about how plants grew during different times of the year. Indigenous people paid special attention to the moon, and used it as their calendar to know what month it was. Each month, or moon, had a special name. Depending on where you lived, the month might have a different name. For example, June is called odemin geezis or Strawberry moon. It's called strawberry moon because that is when the strawberries are ripe to harvest. This term is from the Anishinaabemowin language. It is spoken by communities of the Anishinaabe Nation, one of the first groups in the Great Lakes region. Different communities in different areas had different names for moons, depending on the resources in their area. In Minnesota, August is called wild rice moon. May is called flower moon. Plants help tell time.
