Data from magnetometers dragged behind ships looking for enemy submarines in WWII discovered magnetic patterns on the seafloor. Rocks of normal and reversed polarity are found in stripes symmetrically about the mid-ocean ridge axis. The age of seafloor rocks increases from the ridge crest to rocks the farthest from the ridges. Still, the rocks of the ocean basins are much younger than most of the rocks of the continents. The discovery of seafloor spreading together with magnetic data from the seafloor gave a mechanism of movement to Wegener's theory of continental drift and led to the formation of the theory of plate tectonics.
