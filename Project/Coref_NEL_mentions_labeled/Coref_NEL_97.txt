Is it the data or the theory? Jean-Baptiste Lamarck proposed the idea that evolution occurs, but he did not suggest how it occurs. Darwin's theory of evolution by natural selection did discuss how evolution occurs. Though Darwin agreed with Lamarck that evolution occurs, he differed with Lamarck on several other points. Lamarck proposed that traits acquired during one's lifetime could be passed to the next generation. We now this is does not occur. Discuss with the class how some data may not agree with an accepted scientific theory because sometimes the data is mistaken or fraudulent. Other times the theory may be wrong.
