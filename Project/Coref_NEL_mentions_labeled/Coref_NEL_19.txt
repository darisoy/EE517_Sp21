16 Electronic and Molecular Geometry Lesson Objectives The student will: identify the most likely type of bonding (ionic, covalent, or polar covalent) for each compound given binary formulas and an electronegativity chart. draw Lewis structures for simple molecules that violate the octet rule. from a list of binary compounds, identify those that require electron promotion in the explanation of their bonding. identify the type of hybridization in various molecules. explain the necessity for the concept of hybridized orbitals.
