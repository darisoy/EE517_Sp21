As you have already read, prior to the attack on Pearl Harbor, President Roosevelt vowed that the US would become the world's arsenal of democracy. The United States was true to FDR's word and became the hub of weapons and military manufacturing. The dramatic increase in sales of US production towards the war lifts America out of the Great Depression. Factories that once made goods for consumers (like cars and household appliances) converted to factories that made goods for the war (like planes, Jeeps and tanks). At it's height of production, Ford Motor Company was producing a B-25 bomber every hour. By the end of the war the United States was manufacturing 50% of all manufactured goods globally, and made up only 5% of the world's population.
