If you are a girl and use tampons, be sure to change them every 4 to 6 hours. Leaving tampons in too long can put you at risk of toxic shock syndrome. This is a serious condition. You should also get in the habit of doing a monthly self-exam to check for breast cancer. Although breast cancer is rare in teens, it's a good idea to start doing the exam when you are young. It will help you get to know what is normal for you. Ask a health care provider if you have any questions.
