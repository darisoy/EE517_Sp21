Typhoid Mary Mary Mallon emigrated from Ireland to America at the age of 15. When she arrived she became a servant, and soon discovered a talent for cooking. Since the cook in households earned a higher salary, she was happy to change from a simple servant to this role. She worked in 8 households from 1900-1907 as the cook, leaving a trail of 51 people seriously ill with typhoid, one of whom, a small girl, died of the disease.
