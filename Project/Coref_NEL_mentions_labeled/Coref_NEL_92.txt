Vocabulary: pilgrimage A New Empire Rises As Ghana fell, a new empire, Mali, came to power. Mali rose as a powerful empire around the year 1200. It began as a small city-state of Ghana, but when Mali's leader, Sundiata, led a rebellion against Ghana, they took over the territory and power that was once Ghana's. Once Mali (under Sundiata's rule) came into power, they acquired even more land and took over the gold and salt trade that Ghana once controlled. Trading was expanded to include Egypt. This helped increase Mali's wealth and this wealth helped them to strengthen their army. Look at the map below to see how Ghana and Mali together became the single empire of Mali. The most famous ruler of Mali was Mansa Musa. Mansa Musa was a strong ruler who used Mali's money wisely. He built up the army, but also built up the empire. The popular city, Timbuktu, was enhanced and became a place to learn. People would come to study medicine, astronomy, or mathematics. He also adopted Islam and went on a pilgrimage to the city of Mecca in Southwestern Asia. A pilgrimage is a journey to a sacred place. Mansa Musa's pilgrimage brought a lot of attention and trade money to Mali. After Mansa Musa died, Mali struggled. Weaker rulers came into power and the empire began to decline in the year 1400. This presented the opportunity for smaller kingdoms to attack and rebel, thus weakening the empire further.
