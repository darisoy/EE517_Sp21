As you learned int he last section, this region has a longer growing season than the Great Lakes Farm and Factory region. Therefore, throughout its history, this region has relied on agriculture. The growing season is much longer there (over 200 frost free days in some places each year!) Throughout its history, the south relied on agriculture. Crops like tobacco, rice, sugar, and cotton have all been grown in the south because of the length of the growing season and the amount of rainfall. More recently, over the last 75-100 years, other economic activities have become important in the Southern Plantation Region. Agriculture is still important to the region but it has also begun to see a rise in industry, particularly in the building of cars, communication technologies, banking and oil production. For parts of this region such as Texas, oil is a very important natural resource.
