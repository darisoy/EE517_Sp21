On the Galapagos, Darwin observed that the same kind of animal differed from one island to another. For example, the iguanas (large lizards) differed between islands. The members of one iguana species spent most of their time in the ocean, swimming and diving underwater for seaweed, while those of other iguana species lived on land and ate cactus. Darwin wondered why there were two species of iguana on the same set of islands that were so different from one another. What do you think?
