He will give the rest of the springbok skin to his mother to turn into a blanket (karos) or a piece of clothing for his new baby sister. His mother will scrape the skin with a sharp stone or metal blade to remove the hair and rub it with animal fat for a long time to make it soft. Heitsi slings the quiver in which he keeps his arrows over his shoulder. The quiver is made from tree bark. It is a good quiver, but he really wants one made of animal skin like the one his father carries. The arrows inside the quiver have wooden shafts and sharp tips made of metal. His younger cousins have arrows with tips made of hardwood. In the old days all the arrow tips were made of wood or bone, but Heitsi's people have been making contact with other peoples who have introduced them to metal. He also keeps some tinder in his quiver. Tinder is the name for the soft, dry plant materials his people use when starting a fire. Another item he keeps in the quiver is a hollow reed that can be used like a straw to suck up water that has collected on the leaves of plants.
