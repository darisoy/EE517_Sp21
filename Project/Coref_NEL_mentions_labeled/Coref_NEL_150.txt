With the Nazi invasion of the Soviet Union, Roosevelt began widening the Lend-Lease program to include shipments of supplies to the Soviets. However, as American shipments of supplies increased across the Atlantic, the expanded traffic and lengthy supply lines attracted the attention of German submarines (U-boats). In order to cut Britain and Russia's Lend-Lease lifelines to the United States, hundreds of German U-boats relentlessly preyed upon Allied shipping. As Allied losses mounted throughout the spring and fall of 1941, confrontations between the Germany and the United States increased. In September, a German U-boat fired on a U destroyer in the Atlantic. Despite neutrality with Germany, Roosevelt ordered the Navy to shoot U-boats on sight. In October, U-boats torpedoed two American destroyers on convoy duty within a week of each other, including the U Reuben James, which sank with 115 lives lost. This undeclared naval war in the Atlantic led Congress to pass legislation allowing the arming of merchant ships, in addition to permitting U vessels to sail into belligerent ports. Hitler had initially hoped to avoid war with the United States, which would create a two-front war for Germany. Yet, Germany and the United States remained on a collision course. Events in December of 1941 changed everything.
