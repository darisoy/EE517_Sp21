The girl in the photo just finished coming down the water slide. When she was at the top of the slide, she had potential energy. Why? She had the potential to slide into the water because of the pull of gravity. As she moved down the slide, her potential energy changed to kinetic energy. By the time she reached the water, the potential energy had changed to kinetic energy.
