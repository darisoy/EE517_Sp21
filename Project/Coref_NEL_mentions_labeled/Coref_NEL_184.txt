Non-Mendelian Modes of Inheritance The relationship between genotype and phenotype is rarely as simple as the examples Mendel studied. Each characteristic he studied had two alleles, one of which was completely dominant and the other completely recessive. Geneticists now know that alleles can be codominant, or incompletely dominant.
