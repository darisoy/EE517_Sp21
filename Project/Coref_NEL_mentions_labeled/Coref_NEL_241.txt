Bulimia Nervosa Bulimia nervosa is characterized by cycles of binge eating followed by purging to eliminate the food from the body. Purging may be achieved through intentional vomiting or excessive use of laxatives. People with this disorder typically have normal weight or weight slightly greater than normal. Repeated purging can lead to dehydration. Excessive vomiting can damage the teeth and organs of the digestive system. Bulimia nervosa occurs most often in teenage girls and young women.
