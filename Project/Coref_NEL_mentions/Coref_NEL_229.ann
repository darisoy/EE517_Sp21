A scientific law (a statement that summarizes the results of many observations and experiments) describes an observed pattern in data that occurs without any known exception, for example, Newton's laws of motion. A scientific law that has withstood the test of time is incorporated into the field of knowledge. Because they explain the patterns described in laws, theories can be used to predict future events. In this video a teacher discusses the difference between a theory and a law:  Experimentation The scientific method requires that observations be made. Sometimes the phenomenon we wish to observe does not occur in nature or is inconvenient for us to observe. If we can arrange for the phenomenon to occur at our convenience, we can control other variables and have all of our measuring instruments on hand to help us make observations. An experiment is a controlled method of testing a hypothesis under the conditions we want at a time and place of our choosing. When scientist
