Many Progressives hoped to see government develop more social welfare programs to ensure a basic standard of living for Americans. As reformers looked to government for action and support, their demands for change led to much legislation and reforms at all levels of government. Local Government Political Corruption. During the Progressive Era, corrupt political machines ran many local governments and bribery to obtain votes was commonplace. A political machine is an informal political group designed to gain and keep power and led by a powerful party boss. Party bosses would often provide necessities such as jobs, housing, food, heat, and police protection to citizens in exchange for votes. Tammany Hall was a well-known political machine in New York led by William Marcy Tweed. Boss Tweed would often use bribes to obtain votes, though he was eventually arrested for corruption and sent to prison. In other instances of corruption, politicians were often paid to look the other way concerning certain business practices. Many wealthy entrepreneurs used their economic advantages to obtain political ones. Businessmen dominating important industries often used their power and influence to bribe politicians to pass laws that would benefit them.
