Kinetic-Potential Energy Changes Mechanical energy commonly changes between kinetic and potential energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of moving objects. Potential energy is energy that is stored in objects, typically because of their position or shape. Kinetic energy can be used to change the position or shape of an object, giving it potential energy. Potential energy gives the object the potential to move. If it does, the potential energy changes back to kinetic energy. That's what happened to Sari. After she and Daniel left the theater, the storm cleared and they went to the pool. When she was at the top of the slide, she had potential energy. Why? She had the potential to slide into the pool because of the pull of gravity. As she moved down the slide, her potential energy changed to kinetic energy. By the time she reached the pool, all the potential energy had changed to kinetic energy.
