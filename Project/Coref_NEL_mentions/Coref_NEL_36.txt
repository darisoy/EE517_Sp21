Spanish Civil War Spanish General Francisco Franco led a rebellion against his country's republican government, seeking to replace it instead with a fascist government. Both Mussolini and Hitler supported the move with troops and weapons, including the use of the German Luftwaffe to bomb civilians in the Spanish city of Guernica. After three years of fighting, Franco's fascist troops prevailed, and another European country fell to fascism. Once again, France, Great Britain and the United States stood by, alarmed by the direction events were headed, but unwilling to be dragged into another potential war. The Spanish Civil War, along with the economic sanctions imposed on Italy after the invasion of Abyssinia, cemented the relationship between Italy and Germany. After signing a treaty of friendship with Hitler, Mussolini announced the creation of a Rome-Berlin axis around which all European states that desire peace can revolve. By 1937, the alliance of Italy, Germany and Japan (the Axis Powers) was complete.
