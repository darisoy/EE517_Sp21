A great example of people specializing deals with a product made right here in Michigan! It happened a long time ago when people began making cars in the Detroit area. Henry Ford, a car maker, improved upon the idea of an assembly line, and it allowed the people who worked for him to specialize in certain aspects of making cars. The assembly line is a great example of division of labor which is breaking down the production of a good into many small jobs. Each of these jobs is done by different workers.
