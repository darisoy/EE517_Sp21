How could the girl regain her potential energy? She could climb up the steps to the top of the slide. It takes kinetic energy to climb the steps and this energy would be stored in her position on the stairs as she climbed. By the time she got to the top of the slide, she would have the same amount of potential energy as before. Friction, which is the resistance of an object to movement, also causes changes in kinetic energy. Rub your hands rapidly together. What do you feel? Friction causes the kinetic energy of the rubbing hands to be converted to heat energy which is why your hands feel warm. On a normal friction would slow the girl down on the slide. Since water reduces friction however on this slide she can get going much faster. As a rule of thumb when there is motion there is some amount of friction occurring as well which causes some of the energy to end up as heat.
