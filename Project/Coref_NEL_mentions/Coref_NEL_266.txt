the colonies were of African descent. A similarity between Northern and Southern slaves is that there were some slaves that worked on small farms or in the Image source:  cities. However, the majority of Southern slaves lived and worked on plantations. Remember, plantations are a special type of farm where specialty crops are grown by resident labor (slaves in this case). These large plantations held hundreds of slaves. Plantation life was very difficult. Slave owners in the South knew the slaves were the key to their plantation surviving and for them to make money. Because of this, they often forced the slaves to work long hours. Some slave owners even admitted to making their slaves work by candle and moonlight. Some slaves came to America with special skills because of where they grew up. Remember, slaves came from one of eight primary locations in Africa. Based on that location, a slave could have a special skill to contribute to the plantation. For example, some slaves from West Africa were skilled at growing rice since they grew in their home villages. These slaves were specifically used to help build the rice production of the Carolinas along the Atlantic coast. No matter what skills they had when they came to the colonies, slaves were immediately put to work. Due to the harsh lifestyle of the plantations, enslaved people in the South no say about keeping their families together. Mothers and their children could be sold to different owners. Slave owners also had the right to sell a slave at any time. It often happened that slave owners would sell the children of slaves to make some extra money. This was very hard on Southern slaves.
