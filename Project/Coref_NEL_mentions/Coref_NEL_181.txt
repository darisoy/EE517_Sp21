The Knights of Labor began as a secret society in 1869 and would not become more public until 1881. The Knights championed both skilled and unskilled laborers and included women and African Americans. Their main goal was to set a standard eight hour workday and improve safety conditions at factories. The Knights also pushed for the abolition of child labor and equal pay for equal work. The Knights' membership piqued in 1886 after a successful strike against Jay Gould's Wabash Railroad in 1885. The Knights of Labor faced an untimely setback when they were linked to anarchist bombs at the Haymarket Square protest in Chicago in 1886. The public backlashed against the alleged connection to the incident and the Knights of Labor plummeted to approximately 100,000 members by 1889. The other downfall for the union was that there were many tensions between skilled workers and unskilled workers which led to internal disputes and resentment.
