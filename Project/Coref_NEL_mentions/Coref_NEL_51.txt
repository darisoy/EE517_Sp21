Samuel Gompers While the AFL championed skilled laborers, radical union ideas emerged throughout the United States. Eugene V. Debs championed the idea of a union including all laborers. Debs' American Railway Union won a strike in 1894 which increased its membership by the thousands. However, his union was short lived as membership dwindled only after a successful strike. The Industrial Workers of the World (IWW), a socialist union, formed in Chicago in 1905. By including African Americans and being too radical, its numbers rarely exceeded 100,000. While both unions had few successes, they contributed to the idea that members should unite for the betterment of their lives and working conditions.
