The Soviet Union threatened to back up Egypt with military force, causing the United States to step in and persuade all sides to withdraw in order to end the crisis. The Cold War may have been a struggle between two superpowers, but it had global implications. As the United States and the Soviet Union competed for supremacy and allies, many nations were impacted or drawn into the conflict. Due to the threat of nuclear destruction, the hostilities never evolved into a hot war. The dependence on nuclear weapons as a form of foreign policy, however, had a far-reaching impact. Even Eisenhower feared that nuclear weapons might become more of a threat to security than a stabilizer. Eisenhower warned in his farewell address that the potential for the disastrous rise of misplaced power exists and will persist. He feared that the military-industrial complex created out of need to keep Americans safe could potentially weaken or destroy the very principles and institutions it was designed to protect.
