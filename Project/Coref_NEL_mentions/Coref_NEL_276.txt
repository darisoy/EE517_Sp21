Direct and Inverse Relationships Newton's second law shows that there is a direct relationship between force and acceleration. The greater the force that is applied to an object of a given mass, the more the object will accelerate. For example, doubling the force on the object doubles its acceleration. The relationship between mass and acceleration is different. It is an inverse relationship. In an inverse relationship, when one variable increases, the other variable decreases. The greater the mass of an object, the less it will accelerate when a constant force is applied. For example, doubling the mass of an object results in only half as much acceleration for the same amount of force. Q: Tony has greater mass than the other two boys he is racing above. How will this affect his acceleration around the track? A: Tony's greater mass will result in less acceleration for the same amount of force.
