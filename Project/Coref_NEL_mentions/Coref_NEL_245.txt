Plato was a student of Socrates, and Aristotle was a student of Plato. These three were probably the greatest thinkers of their time. Aristotle's views on physical science were, in particular, highly influential and widely accepted until well into the 1300s. Unfortunately, many of Aristotle's opinions were wrong. Aristotle was a brilliant man without doubt, but he was using a method unsuitable for determining the nature of the physical world. The philosopher's method depended on logical thinking and not on observing the natural world. This led to many errors in Aristotle's views on nature. Let's consider two of Aristotle's ideas as examples. In Aristotle's opinion, men were bigger and stronger than women, so it was logical to him that men would have more teeth than women do. Thus, Aristotle concluded this as a fact without actually counting the number of teeth in any mouths. Had he done so, he would have found that men and women have exactly the same number of teeth. As another example, Aristotle considered what would happen if he were to drop two balls identical in all ways but mass. In his mind, it was clear that the heavier ball would fall faster than a lighter one would, and he concluded that this must be a law of nature. Once again, he did not consider doing an experiment to see which ball would fall faster. This conclusion, however, was also incorrect. Eighteen centuries later, Galileo tried this experiment by dropping two balls of different masses off a building (the Leaning Tower of Pisa, according to legend). Galileo discovered, by experimental observation, that the two balls hit the ground at exactly the same time. Aristotle's logical conclusion was again wrong.
