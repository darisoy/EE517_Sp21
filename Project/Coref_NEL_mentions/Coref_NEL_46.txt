Moon Phases When the Moon revolves around Earth, the position of the moon changes. As the position of the moon changes, different sides of the Moon are lit. When the Moon is completely dark, we call this phase the New Moon. After the New Moon phase, we are able to see more of the Moon as the Moon lights up. When the Moon is getting bigger (lighting up from the reflection of the Sun) we call this waxing. We know when the Moon is waxing because the right side of the Moon is lit. The Moon waxes until the entire face of Moon from Earth is lit. When the entire face of the Moon is lit, we call this phase Full Moon. After Full Moon phase, the Moon's light starts to diminish and we see less of the Moon. This process is called waning. We know when the Moon is waning because the left side of the moon is lit.
