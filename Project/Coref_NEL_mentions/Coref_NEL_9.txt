Figure 4 Until recently plastic bags were a big problem in our beautiful country because they littered the countryside. Think of all the places where these bags could be seen and think of all the things that they could have been used for. You pick up a plastic bag in the street. It is dirty; torn and full of rubbish. The bag's name is Baggie. Draw a comic strip about the life of Baggie a life full of danger; with many experiences; but still a useful life in which he served a good purpose.
