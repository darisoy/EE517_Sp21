Consider the following reaction: Ca(OH)2(s) + 2NH4Cl(s) CaCl2(s) + 2NH3(g) + 2H2O(g) Which one of the following best describes the type of reaction which takes place? (a) Redox reaction (b) Acid-base reaction (c) Dehydration reaction 15 Summary There are many different types of reactions that can take place. These include acid-base, acid-carbonate, redox, addition, substitution and elimination reactions. The Arrhenius definition of acids and bases defines an acid as a substance that increases the concentration of hydrogen ions (H+ or H3O+) in a solution. A base is a substance that increases the concentration of hydroxide ions (OH) in a solution. However this definition only applies to substances that are in water. The Bronsted-Lowry definition is a much broader one. An acid is a substance that donates protons and a base is a substance that accepts protons.
