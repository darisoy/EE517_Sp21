Work Shall Set You Free photo courtesy of Kim Noga Major events of the Holocaust: Kristallnacht Translated Kristallnacht means Crystal Night but has become known as the Night of Broken Glass because of the piles of shattered glass from Jewish homes, businesses and synagogues after a night of plundering and destruction. This night of antiJewish violence took place on November 9-10, 1938 in Germany, Austria and occupied Czechoslovakia. Instigated by Nazi Party officials and Hitler Youth, they were instructed to remove synagogue archives and deliver them to the government before vandalizing. They were also ordered to jail as many Jews as local jails could hold, targeting young, healthy men first.
