Guidance When using the Universal Law of Gravity formula and the constant G above, make sure to use SI units of meters and kilograms. The direction of the force of gravity is in a straight line between two objects. It is always attractive. Newton relied on calculus in order to prove that for a spherical object (like Earth) one can assume all of its mass is at the center of the sphere (thus in his formula, one can use the radius of Earth for the distance between a falling rock and Earth). Newton's Laws apply to all forces; but when he developed them only one was known: gravity. Newton's major insightand one of the greatest in the history of sciencewas that the same force that causes objects to fall when released is also responsible for keeping the planets in orbit.
