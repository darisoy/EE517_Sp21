All crocodilians have, like humans, thecodont dentition, (teeth set in bony sockets), but unlike mammals, they replace their teeth throughout life. Crocodilians also have a secondary bony palate that enables them to breathe when partially submerged, even if the mouth is full of water. Their internal nostrils open in the back of their throat, where a special part of the tongue called the palatal valve closes off their respiratory system when they are underwater, allowing them to breathe when submerged. Crocodiles and gharials (large crocodilians having elongated jaws) have modified salivary glands on their tongue (salt glands), which are used for excreting excess salt ions from their bodies. Crocodilians are often seen lying with their mouths open, a behavior called gaping. One of its functions is probably to cool them down, but it may also have a social function. Like mammals and birds and unlike other reptiles, crocodiles have a four-chambered heart; however, unlike mammals, oxygenated and deoxygenated blood can be mixed. Crocodilians are known to swallow stones, known as gastroliths, which act as a ballast in addition to aiding post-digestion processing of their prey. The crocodilian stomach is divided into two chambers, the first is powerful and muscular, like a bird gizzard, where the gastroliths are found. The other stomach has the most acidic digestive system of any animal and can digest mostly everything from their prey: bones, feathers and horns.
