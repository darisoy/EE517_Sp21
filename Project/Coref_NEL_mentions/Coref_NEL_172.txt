Natural Selection Darwin summarized his observations and ideas as the principle of natural selection. This principle is one of the most important ideas in life science. Simply stated, an individual in a species that has traits (genes) that are best suited to survive changes in the environment are the ones that live and reproduce. This increases the presence of those traits (genes) in the species until it eventually becomes a characteristic of that species.
