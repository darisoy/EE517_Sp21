How did the United States get the government it has? Who formed it? Why did they form it? Those are tough questions. Maybe it would be best to begin with a story. A Story Once upon a time there was a small island country called Dnalgne where the people were ruled by a king. The king pretty much had all the power on the island. He was clearly in charge and made the rules and decisions. Since the island was small, some people decided to leave the island and sail far across an ocean to live in a new place. When they got there they settled on a large piece of land much larger than the island. The king, however, sent a message reminding them that even though they were far from his island he was still their ruler. For a while this didn't seem to matter because the king pretty much left them alone. They began to make some of their own laws and decisions. They liked being on their own without the king telling them what to do. This made the King angry! He told them they couldn't make their own laws and they couldn't make their own decisions. He was in charge! He would make the laws and he would make decisions for them. This made the people angry! They had learned to enjoy the freedom of the new place away from the king. They sent a message to the king that they wanted to be their own country. When he read the message he nearly exploded with anger. He sent his soldiers across the ocean to where the people had moved. But the people were ready for them and ready to fight for their freedom. There was a long, hard conflict but in the end the people won. The king gave in and allowed them to have their own country. But now they were on their own! They had their own country! Should they form a government? Do they need one?
