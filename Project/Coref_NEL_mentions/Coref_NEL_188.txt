Light is energy that travels as a wave. Visible light is part of the electromagnetic spectrum. Telescopes make distant objects appear both nearer and larger. You can see many more stars through a telescope than with the unaided eye. Optical telescopes are designed to collect visible light. The two types of optical telescopes are reflecting telescopes and refracting telescopes. Radio telescopes collect and focus radio waves from distant objects. Space telescopes are telescopes orbiting Earth. They can collect wavelengths of light that are normally blocked by the atmosphere. Galileo was the first person known to use a telescope to study the sky. His discoveries helped change the way humans think about the universe. Modern telescopes collect data that can be stored on a computer. A spectrometer produces a spectrum from starlight. Astronomers can learn a lot about a star by studying its spectrum.
