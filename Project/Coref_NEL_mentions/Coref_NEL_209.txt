Divide into groups of at least five. 2. Attach one end of the fishing line to the blackboard with tape. Have one teammate hold the other end of the fishing line so that it is taut and roughly horizontal. The line must be held steady and must not be moved up or down during the experiment. 3. Have one teammate blow up a balloon and hold it shut with his or her fingers. Have another teammate tape the straw along the side of the balloon. Thread the fishing line through the straw and hold the balloon at the far end of the line. 4. Let go of the rocket and observe how the rocket moves forward. 5. Optionally, the rockets of each group can be timed to determine a winner of the fastest rocket.
