Copernicus did not publish his new model until he was close to death. He may have thought that it could be considered heresy to say that Earth was in motion. Most people did not accept Copernicus' model. One of the few that did was Galileo. He tried to find evidence to support the Copernican model. He discovered the law of inertia which he used to explain why we cannot easily sense that Earth is in motion. Through his telescope, Galileo saw moons orbiting Jupiter. He proposed that this was like the planets orbiting the Sun.
