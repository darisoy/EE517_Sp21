X-I nactivation Early in embryonic development in females, one of the two X chromosomes is randomly inactivated in nearly all somatic cells. This process, called X-inactivation, ensures that females, like males, have only one functional copy of the X chromosome in each cell. Xinactivation creates a Barr body, named after their discover, Murray Barr. The Barr body chromosome is generally considered to be inactive, however there are a small number of genes that remain active and are expressed.
