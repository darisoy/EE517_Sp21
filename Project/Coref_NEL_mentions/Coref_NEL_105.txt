National Archives  menu=closed&mode=search&sortBy=relevance&q=prohibition&commit=Go&page=2 In Detroit alone, there was an estimated number of illegal bars between 15,000 to 25,000 known as speakeasies by 1925. Detroit's location, situated on the international border with Canada, with only the Detroit River separating the two countries, provided the perfect opportunity for organized crime to flourish. Seventy-five percent of all alcohol smuggled into the United States during prohibition, came across the Detroit River from Canada. The Purple Gang, led by the Bernstein brothers, took advantage of the situation and controlled smuggling and distribution operations in Detroit throughout the decade of the 1920s. Al Capone, one of the most infamous gangsters during the prohibition era, counted on Detroit's Purple Gang to supply his mob with illegal alcohol. Instead of curing many of society's ills, it soon became clear that prohibition was having the opposite effect, leading to a rise in violence and crime and a breakdown of order. Instead of stopping the production, sale and distribution of alcohol, prohibition pushed the manufacture and drinking of alcohol underground, often accompanied by devastating outcomes. People began to make their own alcohol, known as bathtub gin or moonshine in their homes. Bootleggers also tried to stretch their supply of alcohol by diluting it with substances such as wood alcohol, rubbing alcohol, or other lethal chemicals that could lead to ailments from blindness to death.
