He picks up his bow, and admires it for a moment. He made it himself from the flexible wood of a wild olive tree. The bow string is made from the gut of a small wild cat that he hunted last summer. His uncle's bow has a string made of twisted palm leaves, and it makes a beautiful sound when Uncle holds the end of the bow in his mouth and taps against the string with a stick. Tonight, when they return from the hunt, the men will dance around the fire while the women sing and clap their hands. There will be stories told about the hunt, and Heitsi will honour the soul of the springbok that he has killed.
