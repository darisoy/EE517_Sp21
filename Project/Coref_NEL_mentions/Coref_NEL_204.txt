Human reproductive organs Puberty is a time when the human reproductive organs start to develop, maturing about 5 6 years after puberty started. In males, the reproductive organs include the penis and two testes hanging in a pouch or bag of skin called the scrotum. At the start of puberty the scrotum starts to grow larger and pubic hair starts to appear. The penis also grows bigger. Inside the scrotum, the testes mature and start to produce sperm. When the male reproductive organs are mature in an adult, they will look as they do in the following diagram: The female reproductive organs include the vagina, uterus, two fallopian tubes (oviducts) and two ovaries. Inside the girl's body the uterus becomes longer and the lining of the uterus becomes thicker. When a girl is born she already carries millions of eggs (also called ova) in two organs called the ovaries. During puberty, the ovaries mature, and start to release one mature egg each month. This is called ovulation. Two tubes connect the uterus with the ovaries these are called the fallopian tubes or the oviducts. When the female reproductive organs are mature in an adult, they will look as they do in the following diagram: NEW WORDS conception ejaculate sexual intercourse umbilical cord We now know more about the male and female sexual organs and how these organs mature during puberty.
