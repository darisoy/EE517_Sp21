The Southern Cross, Crux, and the two bright Pointer stars were used by farmers to mark the beginning of the planting season. According to Sotho, Tswana and Venda traditions, these stars were called Dithutlwa, meaning "The Giraffes". The bright stars of Crux are male giraffes, and the two Pointers are female giraffes. Another example is the constellation Orion. It is named after Orion, a supernaturally, strong hunter in Greek mythology. This is one of the most recognised constellations around the world and many cultures have identified with it, each forming their own myths, many around a strong man or hunter.
