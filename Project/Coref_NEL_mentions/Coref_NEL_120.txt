B. Magnetism It is said that the Greeks discovered a strange type of stone more than 2 000 years ago. While Magnes, a young shepherd boy, was looking after sheep one day, he realised that a strange black stone that exerted so much force on it that he could not withdraw the staff attracted the iron tip of his staff. The fable suggests that the word 'magnet: is derived from the name of this boy. Of course, we cannot verify this, but it is a fact that certain kinds of black stone attract similar stones and certain metals. Many such stones are found in the vicinity of Magnesia, in Turkey, and they are called lodestones, or magnet stones. The word 'magnet: therefore is probably derived from the name of this city. These stones are natural magnets. We nowadays use synthetic magnets made of iron or steel. These magnets are manufactured to attract objects very forcefully and to retain their magnetism for a long time. The magnets in your  laboratory may come in any of the following four different shapes: Bar-shaped magnets Horseshoe-shaped magnets continued on next page Cylindrical magnets continued on next page Ring-shaped magnets Table 2 Magnets have to be handled with care to prevent loss of magnetism. Bear the following in mind when you use a magnet: Do not handle the magnets roughly,  do not drop it or knock against it. Do not heat magnets. Always store magnets with their locking devices in position.
