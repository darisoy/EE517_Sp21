The Townshend Acts British Parliament still needed money after the Stamp Act was repealed. They passed another law taxing the colonies. The man who was in charge of King George's finances, Charles Townshend, suggested some new laws that might benefit England. These laws became known as the Townshend Acts. Remember, when England made all of these laws that affected the colonists, the colonists had no say. They had nobody representing them. Again, taxation without representation occurred. This is an important thing to remember when learning about the events that led to the American Revolution.
