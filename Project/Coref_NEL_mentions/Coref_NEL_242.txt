1. Rule 1: An element always has an oxidation number of zero, since it is neutral. In the reaction H2 + Br2 2HBr, the oxidation numbers of hydrogen and bromine on the left hand side of the equation are both zero. 2. Rule 2: In most cases, an atom that is part of a molecule will have an oxidation number that has the same numerical value as its valency. 3. Rule 3: Monatomic ions have an oxidation number that is equal to the charge on the ion. The chloride ion Cl has an oxidation number of -1, and the magnesium ion M g2+ has an oxidation number of +2. 4. Rule 4: In a molecule, the oxidation number for the whole molecule will be zero, unless the molecule has a charge, in which case the oxidation number is equal to the charge. 5. Rule 5: Use a table of electronegativities to determine whether an atom has a positive or a negative oxidation number. For example, in a molecule of water, oxygen has a higher electronegativity so it must be negative because it attracts electrons more strongly. It will have a negative oxidation number (-2). Hydrogen will have a positive oxidation number (+1). 6. Rule 6: An oxygen atom usually has an oxidation number of -2, although there are some cases where its oxidation number is -1. 7. Rule 7: The oxidation number of hydrogen is usually +1. There are some exceptions where its oxidation number is -1. 8. Rule 8: In most compounds, the oxidation number of the halogens is -1.
