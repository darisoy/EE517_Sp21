So if a neutron or two is added or removed from the nucleus, then the chemical properties will not change. This means that such an atom would remain in the same place in the periodic table. For example, no matter how many neutrons we add or subtract from a nucleus with 6 protons, that element will always be called carbon and have the element symbol C (see the periodic table). Atoms which have the same number of protons ( same atomic number Z), but a different number of neutrons ( different N and therefore different mass number A), are called isotopes.
