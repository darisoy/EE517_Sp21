ACTIVITY: Making and designing a skeleton The local museum has asked your school if they have any models of vertebrate skeletons for a display. Farrah has an idea. She loves making things and she also loves animals. So, Farrah has suggested making our own animal skeleton models. We can then better understand the idea of skeletons as structures and use these models to put on display.
