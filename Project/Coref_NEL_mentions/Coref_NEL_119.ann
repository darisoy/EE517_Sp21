T4	Person1 558 1544	Coulomb noticed that a force existed between charged particles. He called this force electrical force. This force was different that the gravitational force between objects with mass. The force between charged particles varied directly with the magnitude of the charges and inversely squared to the distance between the particles. For example, particles with a larger charge (either more negatively charged or positively charged) would have a greater force between them, He also noticed that this force between the charges could be either attractive (between opposite charges) or repulsive (between like charges). This is different that gravitational forces, because gravitational force can only be attractive. Similar to the gravitational force, the electrical force follows the inverse squared law with distance. As the distance between the objects increases, the electrical force between the objects decreases. The relationship between charge, distance, and force is called Coulomb's
