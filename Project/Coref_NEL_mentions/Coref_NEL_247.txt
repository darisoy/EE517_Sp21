Mass and its SI Unit Mass (a measure of the amount of matter in an object) and weight are not the same thing. Although we often use these terms interchangeably, each one has a specific definition and usage. The mass of an object remains the same regardless of where the object is placed. For example, moving a brick to the moon does not cause matter in the brick to disappear or to be removed. The weight of an object is the force of attraction between the object and the Earth (or whatever large, gravity-producing body the object is located on). This attraction is due to the force of gravity. Since the force of gravity is not the same at every point on the Earth's surface, the weight of an object is not constant. The gravitational pull on the object varies and depends on where the object is with respect to the Earth or other gravity-producing object. For example, a man who weighs 180 pounds on Earth would weigh only 45 pounds if he were in a stationary position 4,000 miles above the Earth's surface. This same man would weigh only 30 pounds on the moon, because the moon's gravitational pull is one-sixth that of Earth's. The mass of this man, however, would be the same in each situation because the amount of matter in the man is constant. We measure weight with a scale, which contains a spring that compresses when an object is placed on it. An illustration of a scale is depicted on the left in the diagram below. If the gravitational pull is less, the spring compresses less and the scale shows less weight. We measure mass with a balance, depicted on the right in the diagram below. A balance compares the unknown mass to known masses by balancing them on a lever. If we take our balance and known masses to the moon, an object will have the same measured mass that it had on the Earth. The weight, of course, would be different on the moon. Consistency requires that scientists use mass and not weight when measuring the amount of matter.
