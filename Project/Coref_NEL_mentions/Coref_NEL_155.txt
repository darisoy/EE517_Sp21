The Double Helix In the early 1950s, Rosalind Franklin started working on understanding the structure of DNA fibers. Franklin, together with Maurice Wilkins, used her expertise in x-ray diffraction photographic techniques to analyze the structure of DNA. In February 1953, Francis Crick and James D. Watson of the Cavendish Laboratory in Cambridge University had started to build a model of DNA. Watson and Crick indirectly obtained Franklin's DNA X-ray diffraction data demonstrating crucial information into the DNA structure. Francis Crick and James Watson then published their double helical model of DNA in Nature on April 25th, 1953.
