True 4 LEANER SECTION 4 Content 4 Activity: To study the properties of the moon and to identify their influences on the earth LO 1 LO 2 INTRODUCTION Earth has one moon that orbits it. The moon has no light of its own but reflects sunlight. It takes the moon 29,5 days to orbit the earth. There is no life, air, wind or water on the moon. Comets, asteroids and meteors that have collided with the moon have caused huge craters on the surface. Temperatures on the moon vary from 200 degrees Celsius to -120 degrees Celsius. At different times of the month the moon appears to assume different shapes. This is because the human eye sees different parts of the moon that are illuminated by the sun as the moon orbits around the earth. As the moon orbits, it influences the sea level as the moon has its own gravity, which affects the sea. This change in water levels is called the tides.
