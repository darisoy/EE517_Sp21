Influences on the unborn baby During pregnancy, what the mother eats, drinks and takes into her body has been shown to directly affect the unborn child. Other substances like smoking, alcohol and drugs have a negative influence on an unborn baby. The placenta transports nutrients and oxygen to the foetus, and removes metabolic waste products and carbon dioxide. However, it cannot differentiate between nutrients and harmful products, such as nicotine, alcohol or drugs. If the mother uses these substances during pregnancy, they will most likely pass through the placenta to the foetus causing great harm to the unborn child. Pregnant mothers who drink alcohol during pregnancy may cause irreversible birth defects in their unborn babies. This is called Foetal Alcohol Syndrome.
