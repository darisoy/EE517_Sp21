Roles of Echinoderms are considered a delicacy in some southeastern Asian countries. Some sea cucumber toxins slow down the growth rate of tumor cells, so there is an interest in using these in cancer research. The calcareous external covering of echinoderms is used as a source of lime by farmers in some areas where limestone is unavailable and 4,000 tons of the animals are used each year for this purpose.
