Lymphoma, or lymphatic cancer, is cancer of the lymphatic system. According to the American Cancer Society, in 2007, lymphoma accounted for 4 percent of new cancer cases amongst men and women in the United States. In lymphoma, cells of the lymphatic system grow abnormally. They divide too rapidly and grow without any order or control. Because lymphatic tissue is present in many parts of the body, lymphoma can start almost anywhere. Lymphoma may occur in a single lymph node, a group of lymph nodes, or, sometimes, in other parts of the lymphatic system such as the bone marrow and spleen.
