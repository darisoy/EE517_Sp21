We can write the reaction with an unequal double arrow to show the position of the equilibrium, which does not favour the formation of ions: CH3COOH(aq) + H2O(l) H3O+(aq) + CH3COO(aq) very little ionisation small percentage of molecules ionised Name Formula Ka values Type Hydrobromic acid 1,0 109 strong acid Hydrochloric acid 1,3 106 strong acid Sulfuric acid H2SO4 First H+: 1,0 103 Second H+: 1,0 102 strong acid Oxalic acid H2C2O4 First H+: 5,8 102 Second H+: 6,5 105 weak acid Sulfurous acid H2SO3 First H+: 1,4 102 Second H+: 6,3 108 weak acid Hydrofluoric acid 3,5 104 weak acid Ethanoic acid CH3COOH 1,7 105 weak acid Table 9 Ka values for the ionisation of some common acids. Note that sulfuric, oxalic and sulfurous acid can all lose 2 H+ ions (they are diprotic acids). Bases The dissociation of bases is similar to that of acids in that we look at the Kb values in a similar manner: Strong bases For a strong base like NaOH: NaOH(aq) + H2O(f) Na+(aq) + OH(aq) + H2O(f) [Na+(aq)][OH(aq)] Kb = [NaOH(aq)] The Kb for NaOH is very large (NaOH is a strong base and almost completely dissociates) and shows that the equilibrium lies very far to the OH side of the reaction. As a result we can write the equilibrium as: NaOH(aq) Na+(aq) + OH(aq) almost complete dissociation large percentage of molecules dissociate Weak bases NH3(g) + H2O(f) NH+(aq) + OH(aq) [NH+(aq)][OH(aq)] Kb = 4 [NH3(g)] The Kb for NH3 is approximately 1,8 105 (NH3 is a weak base) and shows that the equilibrium lies to the NH3 side of the reaction. As a result we can write the equilibrium as: NH (g) + H O(l) NH +(aq) + OH(aq) In a balanced chemical equation such as: 2C A + B 3 2 4 [A]1[B]1 a [C]2 very little ionisation small percentage of molecules ionised However, we generally do not include the superscripts when the coefficients in the balanced equation are Worked example 6: Equilibrium constant calculations Ka = [A][B] [C]2 QUESTION Calculate the equilibrium constant for hydrochloric acid added to 1,38 dm3 of water: HCl(aq) + H2O(f) H3O+(aq) + Cl(aq) n(HCl) in solution = 0,005 mol n(Cl) in solution = 87,3 mol SOLUTION Step 1: Calculate the concentration of HCl at equilibrium C(HCl) = n = 0,005 mol = 0,0036  Remember: x1 = x.
