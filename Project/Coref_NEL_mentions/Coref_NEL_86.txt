The Oregon Trail The path that they would take would come to be known as the Oregon Trail--a 2,000 mile path from Independence, Missouri into Oregon country. The trip for these settlers-pioneer families who had sold their possessions and purchased wagons and animals to pull supplies for the six month trek, would be challenging. The rutted trail would following the Platte and Sweetwater Rivers over the Plains, into the Rockies, through the South Pass and then down into the Willamette Valley. The trail would expand to ten miles in some places while in others it was a wagon width. Family groups would form wagon trains and head out together in the spring, crossing over the Missouri River, as Henry Sager did with his six children and wife in 1844. Together, their party totalled 72 wagon and 323 people, seemingly ready for the harrowing trek. Their journey would be one first of tragedy and then new, hopeful beginnings.
