Besides building nests, birds have other instincts. One example occurs in gulls. One of the chicks is pecking at a red spot on the mother's beak, his inherited behavior causes the mother to feed the chick. In many other species of birds, the chicks open their mouths wide whenever the mother returns to the nest. This inherited behavior, called gaping, causes the mother to feed them.
