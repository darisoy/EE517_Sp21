Although Taft was physically a large man at six feet tall and 350 pounds, he did not have the same larger-than-life personality that Roosevelt possessed. This was evidenced by the sheer number of the 90 trusts he busted in his four year term compared to Roosevelt's 44 trusts over a seven year period. He was cautious in his pursuit of the progressive agenda eliminating Roosevelt's distinction between good trusts and bad trusts and hesitated to take advantage of the presidential bully pulpit in the way that was Roosevelt's trademark. He unsuccessfully tried to strike a balance between the conservatives and progressives in his party which Roosevelt had managed to hold together through the sheer force of his personality. Progressives were particularly angry with him over tariffs and conservation. Taft had campaigned on the promise to lower tariffs. This was a fundamental issue for progressives because high tariffs benefited businesses at the expense of consumers. All went according to plan in the House of Representatives where they passed the Payne bill which lowered tariffs on many manufactured goods. Conservative Republicans in the Senate, however, eliminated most of the cuts in their version. Progressives, including Roosevelt, felt betrayed when President Taft signed the PayneAldrich Tariff. He only made matters worse when he referred to it as the the best [tariff] bill the Republican party ever passed in his attempts to defend it.
