Substitute these values for mass and velocity into the equation for kinetic energy: KE=1/240kg(1m/s)2=20kgm2/s2=20 N x m or 20 J Notice that the answer is given in joules (J), or Nm, which is the SI unit for energy. One joule is the amount of energy needed to apply a force of 1 Newton over a distance of 1 meter. What about Juan's dad? His mass 80 kg, and he's running at the same velocity as Juan (1 m/s). Because his mass is twice as great as Juan's, his kinetic energy is twice as great, so 40 J. Q: What is Juan's kinetic energy if he is now traveling 2 m/s? A: 80 J Supplemental Links This is a video introduction to kinetic energy and how it is related to work from Flipping Physics:  You can review kinetic energy at this link:  Check Your Understanding 5. What is kinetic energy?
