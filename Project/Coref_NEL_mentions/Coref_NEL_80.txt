Scientists Who Influenced Darwin Jean Baptiste Lamarck (17441829) was an important French naturalist. He was one of the first scientists to propose that species change over time. However, Lamarck was wrong about how species change. His idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics is incorrect. Traits an organism develops during its own lifetime cannot be passed on to offspring, as Lamarck believed. Charles Lyell (17971875) was a well-known English geologist. Darwin took his book, Principles of Geology, with him on the Beagle. In the book, Lyell argued that gradual geological processes have gradually shaped Earth's surface. From this, Lyell inferred that Earth must be far older than most people believed.
