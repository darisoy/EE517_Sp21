Since we know that velocity is the rate of change of position, we can confirm the value for the velocity vs. time graph, by calculating the gradient of the -x vs. t graph. If we calculate the gradient of the -x vs. t graph for a stationary object we get: = -x f -xi tf ti = 2 m 2 m (initial position = final position) 120 s 60 s = 0 m s1 (for the time that Vivian is stationary ) Similarly, we can confirm the value of the acceleration by calculating the gradient of the velocity vs. time graph. If we calculate the gradient of the -v vs. t graph for a stationary object we get: = -vf -vi tf ti 0 m s1 0 m s1 120 s 60 s = 0 m s2 Additionally, because the velocity vs. time graph is related to the position vs. time graph, we can use the area under the velocity vs. time graph to calculate the displacement of an object. The displacement of the object is given by the area under the graph, which is 0 m. This is obvious, because the object is not moving.
