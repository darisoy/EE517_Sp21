Further Reading / Supplemental Links The  website allows users to view the Annenberg series of chemistry videos. You are required to register before you can watch the videos, but there is no charge to register. The website has two videos that apply to this lesson. One video called Thinking Like Scientists relates to the scientific method. The other video is called Modeling the Unseen.  This website has a video that explores the history of the scientific method.  This video is a ChemStudy film called High Temperature Research. The film is somewhat dated but the information is accurate.  Review Questions Use the following paragraph to answer questions 1 and 2. In 1928, Sir Alexander Fleming was studying Staphylococcus bacteria growing in culture dishes. He noticed that a mold called Penicillium was also growing in some of the dishes. As shown in the illustration below, Petri dish A represents a dish containing only Staphylococcus bacteria. In dishes containing the Penicillium mold, represented by Petri dish B below, Fleming noticed that a clear area existed around the mold because all the bacteria in this area had died. In the culture dishes without the mold, no clear areas were present. Fleming suggested that the mold was producing a chemical that killed the bacteria. He decided to isolate this substance and test it to see if it would kill bacteria. Fleming grew some Penicillium mold in a nutrient broth. After the mold grew in the broth, he removed all the mold from the broth and added the broth to a culture of bacteria. All the bacteria died.
