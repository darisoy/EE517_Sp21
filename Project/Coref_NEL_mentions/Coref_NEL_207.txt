Thomas Alva Edison was one such inventor who transformed American lives. With his perfection of the electric lightbulb in 1879, the night now could become easily become day. Edison would patent electric currents and create the country's first power company which serviced New York City. With that, factories could run longer production hours as they were not limited to sunlight. Along with the economic impact, Americans on average would sleep approximately two hours less per night. Along with invention of the light bulb, communication inventions greatly transformed American lives. Christopher Sholes, a newspaper publisher from Wisconsin, sought ways to increase word typing productivity. In 1867, Sholes was able to perfect the typewriter which allowed for a faster and neater means to scribe messages which included the standard QWERTY keyboard. Alexander Graham Bell, a Scottish born inventor, would successfully complete the first telephone call in 1875 which enabled communication to be faster than ever before. Women greatly benefited from these inventions as they would become staples in offices. Clerical jobs opened up an entire job market to women.
