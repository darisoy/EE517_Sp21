What would happen if an entire chromosome were missing or duplicated? What if a human had only 45 chromosomes? Or 47? This real possibility is usually due to mistakes during meiosis; the chromosomes do not fully separate from each other during sperm or egg formation. Specifically, nondisjunction is the failure of replicated chromosomes to separate during anaphase II. If a zygote forms from a gamete lacking a chromosome, a viable embryo cannot be produced. Most human abnormal chromosome numbers result in the death of the developing embryo, often before a woman
