Calvin Coolidge who was the governor of Massachusetts at the time, called out the National Guard to restore order. The strike was then called off by the police but the commissioner refused to hire back the officers he had fired. When the commissioner hired new officers to replace those he had fired, Samuel Gompers, the president of the American Federation of Labor (AFL) got involved. Appealing to Governor Coolidge on behalf of the fired men, the governor replied by declaring that, There is no right to strike against the public safety by anyone, anywhere, any time. The public praised Governor Coolidge as many felt he had saved Boston from communism and anarchy. The Steel Mill Strike Even more upsetting to the American public was the strike at the U Steel Corporation in September of 1919. Union representatives, representing more than 350,000 workers, attempted to meet with management to plead for shorter hours and a living wage. When the company refused to meet with representatives the strike began.
