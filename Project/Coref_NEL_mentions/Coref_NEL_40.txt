Interreesting FFaacct The original hypothesis that was proposed by Amadeo Avogadro was that 'equal volumes of gases, at the same temperature and pressure, contain the same number of molecules'. His ideas were not accepted by the scientific community and it was only four years after his death, that his original hypothesis was accepted and that it became known as 'Avogadro's Law'. In honour of his contribution to science, the number of particles in one mole was named Avogadro's number.
