Worcester v. Georgia Although the Cherokee had assimilated as Washington and Jefferson had suggested, they, too, could not escape the economic opportunities that farmers and the government saw in the rich, Georgia soil. After the discovery of gold in Georgia, the state militia began attacking towns, attempting to force the Cherokee to leave. White missionaries, like Samuel Worcester, were helping the Cherokees in their fight to keep their lands, prompting Georgia to declare that no white persons could enter Cherokee territory. In response the Cherokee sued the State of Georgia indicating they were an independent nation that that Georgia's laws had no power over them. In the 1832 Supreme Court case ruling, Chief Justice John Marshall sided with the Cherokee in the majority 5 1 decision. The court ruled that the laws of Georgia had no force over the Cherokee since they were an independent nation.
