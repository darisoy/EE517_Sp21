Summary Genetics is the branch of biology that focuses on heredity in organisms. Modern genetics is based on Mendel's explanation of how traits are passed from generation to generation. For each of the seven characteristics Mendel studied, he observed a similar ratio in the inheritance of dominant to recessive traits (3 in the F2 generation. Mendel developed a theory that explained simple patterns of inheritance in which two alleles are inherited to result in one of several traits in offspring. The law of segregation states that a pair of alleles is segregated during the formation of gametes and that each gamete has an equal chance of getting either one of the allele.
