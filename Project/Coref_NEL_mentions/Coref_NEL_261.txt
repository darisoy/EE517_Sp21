The potential energy is a maximum. EP = mgh = (1)(9,8)(2) = 19,6 J The potential energy is a minimum. EP = mgh = (1)(9,8)(0) = 0 J QUESTION A netball player, who is 1,7 m tall, holds a 0,5 kg netball 0,5 m above her head and shoots for the goal net which is 2,5 m above the ground. What is the gravitational potential energy of the ball: 1. when she is about to shoot it into the net? 2. when it gets right into the net? 3. when it lands on the ground after the goal is scored?
