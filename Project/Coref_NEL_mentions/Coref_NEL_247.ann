Although we often use these terms interchangeably, each one has a specific definition and usage. The mass of an object remains the same regardless of where the object is placed. For example, moving a brick to the moon does not cause matter in the brick to disappear or to be removed. The weight of an object is the force of attraction between the object and the Earth

The gravitational pull on the object varies and depends on where the object is with respect to the Earth or other gravity-producing object. For example, a man
