The satellite map you're looking at on this page and in the interactive shows another important human characteristic cities. Cities are built by humans and as such, are important human characteristics of a place. The United States has many cities ranging from small to extremely large. People who live in rural areas of Michigan might feel right at home in a place like Curfew, Iowa. People who live in urban areas of Michigan such as Grand Rapids or Detroit might feel at home in a place like Chicago, New York, or Los Angeles. You can see that while a lot of the cities in the United States are centered in certain places, there are places on the map that do not show very much in the way of light at night. Does that mean that no one lives there? Bridges Let's set aside our geographic puzzle for a moment and talk about another major human characteristic. You learned in third grade that human and natural characteristics are often linked together when you learned about a famous bridge in Michigan known as the Mackinac Bridge. The Mackinac Bridge was built to solve a problem how to quickly travel to the Upper Peninsula. The Mackinac Bridge was not the only time humans grappled with this problem. The Brooklyn Bridge was built in 1883 to connect the island of Manhattan and Brooklyn by spanning the East River in New York City. It is one of the more famous bridges in the eastern United States. One of the most famous on the west coast is the Golden Gate Bridge which opened in 1937 and connects San Francisco to Marin County.
