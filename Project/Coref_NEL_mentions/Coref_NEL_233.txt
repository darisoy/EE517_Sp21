Chapter 25 MS Environmental Problems The image shows smoke pouring into the sky from a factory. This smoke is polluting the air. But what does pollution mean? Is it polluting the air just above the factory? Does the pollution spread? What kind of effects does that kind of smoke have on the environment? What kind of effect does that pollution have on human health? What about factories that pollute waterways, like rivers, lakes, and oceans? How does that kind of pollution affect the environment and human health? More importantly, what do you think you can do to decrease the amount of pollution in the air and waterways? Are there things you can in your daily life? Think about these questions as you read about the environmental consequences of human activities.
