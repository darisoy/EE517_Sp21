a) State, in words, the principle of conservation of linear momentum. b) Calculate the magnitude and direction of the velocity of the 1 kg trolley immediately after the spring has expanded completely. 15. [IEB 2002/11 HG1] A ball bounces back from the ground. Which of the following statements is true of this event? a) The magnitude of the change in momentum of the ball is equal to the magnitude of the change in momentum of the Earth. b) The magnitude of the impulse experienced by the ball is greater than the magnitude of the impulse experienced by the Earth. c) The speed of the ball before the collision will always be equal to the speed of the ball after the collision. d) Only the ball experiences a change in momentum during this event. 16. [SC 2002/11 SG] A boy is standing in a small stationary boat. He throws his schoolbag, mass 2 kg, horizontally towards the jetty with a velocity of 5 m s1. The combined mass of the boy and the boat is 50 kg. a) Calculate the magnitude of the horizontal momentum of the bag immediately after the boy has thrown it. b) Calculate the velocity (magnitude and direction) of the boat-and-boy immediately after the bag is thrown. 17.
