Daniel Fahrenheit established the Fahrenheit scale. On his temperature scale, Fahrenheit designated the freezing point of water as 32F and the boiling point of water as 212F. Therefore, the distance between these two points would be divided into 180 degrees. The Fahrenheit temperature scale is used in the United States for most daily expressions of temperature. In another temperature scale, scientist Anders Celsius designated the freezing point of water as 0C and the boiling point of water as 100C. Therefore, the temperatures between these two points on the Celsius scale are divided into 100. Clearly, the size of a Celsius degree and the size of a Fahrenheit degree are not the same.
