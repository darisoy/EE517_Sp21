Dynamos are also used in mining helmets and wind-up torches and radios. If a miner's light on his helmet goes out, he can just wind up the dynamo again to generate electricity for the light. This is very useful when miners are deep underground and they cannot afford to have no light. A battery-powered light has the risk of running out and there is no way to recharge it when underground. Electricity is very expensive to produce and, in South Africa, we rely heavily on non-renewable sources of energy such as coal. The burning of fossil fuels releases greenhouse gases into the atmosphere, causing damage to our environment. We therefore need to conserve electricity.
