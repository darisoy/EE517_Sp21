In one technique known as companion planting, the three crops are planted close together. The three crops benefit from each other. The maize provides a structure for the beans to climb, eliminating the need for poles. The beans provide the nitrogen to the soil that the other plants utilize, and the squash spreads along the ground, blocking the sunlight, helping prevent establishment of weeds. Native Americans throughout North America are known for growing variations of Three Sisters gardens. The Three Sisters planting method is featured on the reverse of the 2009 US Sacagawea Native American dollar coin. Just like the carbon cycle, human activities impact the nitrogen cycle. These human activities include the burning of fossil fuels, which release nitrogen oxide gas into the atmosphere. Releasing nitrogen oxide back into the atmosphere leads to problems like acid rain.
