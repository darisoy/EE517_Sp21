Draw a free body diagram in the space below to show these forces acting on the desk. [4 marks] c) What is the net force acting on the desk? [1 mark] 5. A force of 50 N and 80 N act on a block. Calculate the net force acting on the block if: a) the forces are acting in the same direction [1 mark] b) the forces are acting in opposite directions [1 mark] Chapter 1. Forces 53 6. Write down three different effects that a force can have on an object. [3 marks] 7. What is the following diagram illustrating? Explain your answer. [4 marks] 8. Tabulate the distinction between mass and weight by making use of definitions of mass and weight and comparing the units they are measured in. [5 marks] 54 Energy and Change 9. Write down the formula that relates the weight of an object to its mass. Explain what each symbol represents. [4 marks] 10. What TWO factors affect the gravitational force experienced between two objects? Explain the relationship. [2 marks] 11. An astronaut performs an experiment to determine the relationship between mass and weight on different planets. He takes a scale and sets off in a spaceship and measures his own weight on different planets in the solar system. The following table indicates his results.
