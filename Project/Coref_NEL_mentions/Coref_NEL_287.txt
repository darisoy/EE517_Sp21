SOLUTION Step 1 : Analyse the question to determine what information is provided the netball net is 2,5 m above the ground the girl has a height of 1,7 m the ball is 0,5 m above the girl's head when she shoots for goal the mass of the ball is 0,5 kg Step 2 : Analyse the question to determine what is being asked We need to find the gravitational potential energy of the netball at three different positions: when it is above the girl's head as she starts to throw it into the when it reaches the net when it reaches the ground Step 3 : Use the definition of gravitational potential energy to calculate the value for the ball when the girl shoots for goal 1. Describe the relationship between an object's gravitational potential energy and its: a. mass and b. height above a reference point. 2. A boy, of mass 30 kg, climbs onto the roof of a garage. The roof is 2, 5 m from the ground.
