Haber was Jewish by birth, but converted from Judaism in order to be more accepted in Germany. Despite this, he was forced to leave the country in 1933 because he was Jewish 'by definition' (his mother was Jewish). He died in 1934 at the age of 65. Many members of his extended family died in the Nazi concentration camps, possibly gassed by Zyklon B.
