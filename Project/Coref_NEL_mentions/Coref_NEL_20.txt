Surrender at Yorktown British General Cornwallis retreated to Yorktown, Virginia where he thought his troops would be safe. Washington marched south from New York with thousands of French and Patriot soldiers. The French navy sailed north from the Caribbean to meet him. The British Army was now surrounded at Yorktown. They were greatly outnumbered by the French and American troops. For eleven days the American forces bombarded (bombed) the British. Finally Cornwallis sent out the white flag for surrender. He originally made a lot of demands to George Washington for his surrender, but Washington didn't agree. When the American troops started to prepare for another attack, Cornwallis agreed to Washington's terms and the battle was over. On October 19, 1781, he was forced to surrender. He gave up and admitted he was defeated.
