The Selma Campaign Early in 1965, the SCLC decided Selma, Alabama would be the focus of a concentrated voter registration drive. Dr. King, who predicted a hostile white response, was hopeful that if would convince the president's administration of the need to sponsor a federal voting-rights law. The month of January saw over 2,000 African Americans arrested in demonstrations, many of which had been brutally attacked by sheriff Jim Clark and his men. In February officers shot and killed a demonstrator. In response, Dr. King announced a 50 mile protest march beginning in Selma and ending at the state's capital of Montgomery. Approximately 600 protesters gathered to begin the march on March 7, 1965 but didn't get far until they encountered Alabama state troopers. Armed with whips, nightsticks, and tear gas, the troopers rushed the crowd at the Edmund Pettus Bridge, pushing the crowd back into the city of Selma. The nationally televised scene shocked Americans and demonstrators from around the country poured into Selma to join the march. President Johnson responded by asking Congress to quickly pass a new voting rights act. On Sunday, March 31st, 3,000 once again set out for Montgomery with federal protection. By the time the marchers reached Montgomery, some 25,000 demonstrators had joined as they all walked into Montgomery.
