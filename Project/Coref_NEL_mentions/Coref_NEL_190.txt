Example 2 Write a balanced equation for the reaction Al2(SO4)3+CaBr2AlBr3+CaSO4 In order to balance the aluminum atoms, we must insert a coefficient of 2 in front of the aluminum compound in the products. Al2(SO4)3+CaBr22AlBr3+CaSO4 In order to balance the sulfate ions (SO42-), we must insert a coefficient of 3 in front of the product CaSO4. Al2(SO4)3+CaBr22AlBr3+3CaSO4 In order to balance the bromine atoms, we must insert a coefficient of 3 in front of the reactant CaBr2. Al2(SO4)3+ 3CaBr22AlBr3+ 3CaSO4 The insertion of the 3 in front of the reactant CaBr2 also balances the calcium atoms in the product CaSO4. A final check shows that there are two aluminum atoms, three sulfur atoms, twelve oxygen atoms, three calcium atoms, and six bromine atoms on each side. This equation is balanced. Note that this equation would still have the same number of atoms of each type on each side with the following set of coefficients: 2Al2(SO4)3+ 6CaBr2 4AlBr3+ 6CaSO4 Count the number of each type of atom on either side of the equation to confirm that this equation is balanced. While this set of coefficients does balanced the equation, they are not the lowest set of coefficients possible. Chemical equations should be balanced with the simplest whole number coefficients. We could divide each of the coefficients in this equation by 2 to get another set of coefficients that still balance the equation and are whole numbers. Since it is required that an equation be balanced with the lowest whole number coefficients, the equation above is not properly balanced. When you have finished balancing an equation, you should not only check to make sure it is balanced, you should also check to make sure that it is balanced with the simplest set of whole number coefficients possible.
