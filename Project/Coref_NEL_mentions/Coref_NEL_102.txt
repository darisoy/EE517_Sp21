Physical changes in girls during puberty Physical changes in boys during puberty The sexual organs (vagina, uterus and ovaries) start to mature. Pubic hair starts to grow on the genitals. Menstruation and fertility: girls have their first menstrual bleeding. Menstruation is a sign that the ovaries have started secreting hormones and releasing eggs, and is therefore a sign that the girl is now fertile (able to fall pregnant). Body shape: changes occur, such as the waist becomes more defined and hips widen (to make space for childbirth). There is an increase in body fat. Breasts start to develop Body odour is typically part of puberty as the skin produces more oils and the smell of sweat changes. Acne and pimples can occur due to changes in hormones and increased oil secretion from the skin.
