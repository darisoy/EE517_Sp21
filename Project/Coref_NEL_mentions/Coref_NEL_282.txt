Mobilizing Support Americans would not have been as willing to sacrifice the free market, ration food, and register for the draft if they did not believe in the cause for which they were being asked to sacrifice. In order to ensure that Americans knew they were making a worthy sacrifice, Wilson approved the creation of the Committee on Public Information, headed by George Creel. The former journalist from Kansas City was tasked with selling the war to the American public. The CPI utilized advertising principles developed through studying psychology, such as dramatizing the evilness of the enemy, to harness the emotions of Americans and rationalize the sacrifices they were making to support the war effort. Propaganda posters were posted to garner support for various war efforts from enlisting in the army, to working in a factory. Amongst many of its efforts, the CPI also trained 4 Minute Men to deliver speeches to educate audiences on America's war aims and efforts.
