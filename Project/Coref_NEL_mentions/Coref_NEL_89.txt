Magnets There is an old folk tale about a Greek shepherd named Mangus. The tale tells about a time Mangus climbed a mountain to rescue a lamb and he found that the iron nails in his sandals stuck to pieces of a particular rock. This type of rock attracts iron and is called lodestone. Lodestone is a natural magnet a mineral made magnetic by Earth's magnetic field. The magnetic field is the area around a magnet where the magnet has power to attract magnetic material. In 1269 A a French scientist, Peter Peregrinus of Maricourt, wrote a letter describing the properties of lodestones. He discovered that there were two points on opposite sides of the lodestone that he called the North Pole and the South Pole. He found that small bits of iron were attracted most strongly at these points. He also found that a small piece of iron shaped like a needle would stand straight up at those two points. When he placed the lodestone in a small wooden bowl floating in a larger container of water, the north pole of the lodestone turned the dish around until its north pole was pointing north.
