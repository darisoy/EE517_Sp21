The Hardy-Weinberg Theorem Hardy was an English mathematician. Weinberg was a German doctor. Each worked alone to come up with the founding principle of population genetics. Today, that principle is called the Hardy-Weinberg theorem. It shows that allele frequencies do not change in a population if certain conditions are met. Such a population is said to be in Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium. The conditions for equilibrium are: 1. No new mutations are occurring. Therefore, no new alleles are being created. 2. There is no migration. In other words, no one is moving into or out of the population. 3. The population is very large. 4. Mating is at random in the population. This means that individuals do not choose mates based on genotype. 5. There is no natural selection. Thus, all members of the population have an equal chance of reproducing and passing their genes to the next generation.
