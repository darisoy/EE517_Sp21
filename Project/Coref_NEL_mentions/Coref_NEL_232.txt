SUMMARY: Key Concepts Ecosystems Ecology is the study of interactions of organisms with one another and with the physical and chemical environment. The study of ecological interactions is conducted at four levels: populations communities ecosystems biosphere(s) All ecosystems combined make up the biosphere. An ecosystem consists of a community that includes all living organisms (biotic) such as plants and animals, together with the non-living (abiotic) environment and climatic conditions such as temperature, air and wind, water, interacting as a system. An ecosystem can refer to a specific area on Earth or the entire biosphere can be regarded as one large ecosystem. The survival of populations and species depends on whether enough individuals are suited to the environmental conditions at the time. As conditions do change over time only those better suited to the changed environment will be able to continue the species. And so over time species adapt. Feeding relationships Plants are producers. They make their own food. Animals are consumers. They obtain food from plants either directly (such as herbivores) or indirectly (such as carnivores). Herbivores feed on plants. Carnivores feed on other animals (living or dead). This group includes: Predators hunt other animals, their prey, for example lions and leopards. Scavengers that eat dead animals, for example hyenas and vultures. Insectivores that eat insects and other small invertebrates such as worms Omnivores feed on plants and animals. Humans are generally omnivores.
