Meiosis II During meiosis II, the sister chromatids are separated and the gametes are generated. The steps are outlined below: 1. Prophase II: The chromosomes condense. 2. Metaphase II: The chromosomes line up one on top of the next along the middle of the cell. 3. Anaphase II: The sister chromatids separate. 4. Telophase II: Nuclear envelopes form around the chromosomes in all four cells.
