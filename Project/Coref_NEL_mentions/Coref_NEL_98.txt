Tillie Smith, Hero Like other waves, a tsunami wave has a crest and a trough. When the wave hits the beach, the crest or the trough may come ashore first. When the trough comes in first, water is sucked out to sea. The seafloor just offshore from the beach is exposed. Curious people often walk out onto the beach to see the unusual sight. They drown when the wave crest hits. One amazing story from the Indian Ocean tsunami is that of Tilly Smith. Tilly was a 10-year-old British girl who was visiting Maikhao Beach in Thailand with her parents. Tilly had learned about tsunami in school two weeks before the earthquake. She knew that the receding water and the frothy bubbles at the sea surface meant a tsunami was coming. Tilly told her parents, who told other tourists and the staff at their hotel. The beach was evacuated and no one on Maikhao Beach died. Tilly is credited with saving nearly 100 people!
