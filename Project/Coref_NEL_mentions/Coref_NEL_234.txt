As possible war with France loomed in the late 1790s, Eli Whitney, a Massachusetts inventor, had an idea to improve the speed and accuracy when producing a musket. Handmade muskets took time to make and the parts were often difficult to assemble. Using the same water-power that mills used, Whitney approached the US government and proposed the idea of massproducing muskets using interchangeable parts, parts made the exact same by a machine tool. This allowed the military to easily replace broken parts of muskets with identical parts from Whitney's factory. The idea was revolutionary. To prove to the government that his system could be used to produce 10,000 muskets, he gave a demonstration to in Washington, D There he disassembled ten guns, mixed up the parts and reassembled them all in front of the Congress and President John Adams to everyone's amazement! Mass production, the production of large amounts of standardized products, would soon become the standard in industry.
