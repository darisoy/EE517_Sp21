Pros and Cons of Marsupial Reproduction In marsupials, the short period of development within the mother's uterus reduces the risk of her immune system attacking the embryo. In addition, the marsupial mother doesn't have to eat extra food or carry a large fetus inside her. The risks of giving birth to a large fetus are also avoided. Another pro is that the mother can expel the embryo from her pouch if she is pursued by a predator or if food is scarce. On the other hand, a newborn marsupial is tiny and fragile. Therefore, it may be less likely to survive than a newborn placental mammal.
