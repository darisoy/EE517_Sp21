In each half-cell a half-reaction takes place: Copper plate At the copper plate, there was an increase in mass. This means that Cu2+ ions from the copper(II) sulfate solution were deposited onto the plate as atoms of copper metal. The half-reaction that takes place at the copper plate is: Cu2+(aq) + 2e Cu(s) As electrons are gained by the copper ions this is the reduction half-reaction. Zinc plate At the zinc plate, there was a decrease in mass. This means that some of the solid zinc goes into solution as Zn2+ ions. The electrons remain on the zinc plate, giving it a negative charge. The half-reaction that takes place at the zinc plate is: Zn(s) Zn2+(aq) + 2e As electrons are lost by the zinc atoms this is the oxidation half-reaction. The overall reaction You can then combine the two half-reactions from these two half-cells to get the overall reaction: Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) + 2e Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) + 2e or, if we cancel the electrons: Zn(s) + Cu2+(aq) Zn2+(aq) + Cu(s) It is possible to look at the half-reaction taking place in a half-cell and determine which electrode is the anode and which is the cathode. Oxidation is loss at the anode, therefore the oxidation half-reaction occurs in the half-cell containing the anode. Reduction is gain at the cathode so the reduction half-reaction occurs in the half-cell containing the cathode. Remember that for an electrochemical cell the standard cell notation is: Zn(s)|Zn2+(aq)||Cu2+(aq)|Cu(s) | = a phase boundary (solid/aqueous) || = the salt bridge Exercise 13 5: Galvanic cells 1.
