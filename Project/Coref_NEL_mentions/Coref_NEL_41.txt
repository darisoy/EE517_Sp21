Dr. Jill Bolte Taylor is a brain scientist. At the age of 37, she suffered massive brain damage when blood vessels burst inside her brain. It took Dr. Taylor almost ten years to recover from the damage to her brain. She had to relearn even basic skills, like walking and talking. To share her story of recovery with others, Dr. Taylor wrote a popular book describing what she went through. Her story gave other people so much inspiration that Time Magazine named her one of the world's 100 most influential people in 2008.
