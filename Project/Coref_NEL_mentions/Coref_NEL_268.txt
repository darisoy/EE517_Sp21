Have you ever heard an echo of your own voice? An echo occurs when sound waves bounce back from a surface that they can't pass through. The girl pictured here is trying to create an echo by shouting toward a large building. When the sound waves strike the wall of the building, most of them bounce back toward the girl, and she hears an echo of her voice. An echo is just one example of how waves interact with matter.
