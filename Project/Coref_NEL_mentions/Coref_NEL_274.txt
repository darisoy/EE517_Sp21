Prior to the Mexican-American War (1846 1848), most of California was made up of indigenous people and Mexicans. Americans who made it to California were mainly traders who'd arrived via the California Trail, the southern route of the Oregon Trail that split off at the Snake River in present-day Idaho. Like traders on the Santa Fe Trail, they traded for gold and silver coins and animal hides with Mexican traders. John Sutter had been given permission by the Mexican government to start a colony in California in 1839. Sutter's Fort was built along the Sacramento River and it became a popular stop for traders and settlers coming west. It was just 100 miles from Sutter's Fort, high in the Sierra Nevada Mountains that a settler group, faced with unimaginable challenges, would go down in history for the decisions they made.

Attempting a shortcut indicated on an inaccurate trail guide, the group of eighty-seven travelers became trapped in approximately six feet of snow without food after eating all their food supplies. The ultimate horrors of the expedition were retold by Patrick Breen in one of his journal entries:  The Donners [sic] told the California folks that they commence to eat the dead people 4 days ago, if they did not succeed that day or the next in finding their cattle then under ten or twelve feet of  February 26, 1847. Forty-five or so people including Breen, his wife and all seven of their children were rescued that February. The story of survival and terrible suffering did not deter future travelers but did educate them on the dangers of leaving too late in the season and taking unknown shortcuts.
