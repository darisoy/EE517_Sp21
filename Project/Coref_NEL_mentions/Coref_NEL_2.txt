Online Interactive Activities Use the following interactive to explore half-life and to find the age of several objects:  This interactive allows you to look at how the number of radioactive isotopes present changes over time. As you work through the interactive:  , look for the following: How could you find the half-life of each isotope? How come some isotopes have really long isotopes and others have longer half-lifes? How does the number of parent (reactant) atoms change over time? How does the number of daughter (product) atoms change over time?
