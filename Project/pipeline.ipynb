            " The theory of gravity has been slowly developing since the beginning of the 16th century. Galileo Galilei is credited with some of the earliest work. At the time it was widely believed that heavier objects accelerated faster toward the earth than light objects did. Galileo had a hypothesis that this was not true, and performed experiments to prove this. Galileo's work allowed Sir Isaac Newton to hypothesise not only a theory of gravity on earth, but that gravity is what held the planets in their orbits. Newton's theory was used by John Couch Adams and Urbain Le Verrier to predict the planet Neptune in the solar system and this prediction was proved experimentally when Neptune was discovered by Johann Gottfried Galle.\n",

            " The principles of the three rules of thermodynamics describe how energy works, on all size levels (from the workings of the Earth's core, to a car engine). The basis for these three rules started as far back as 1650 with Otto von Guericke. He had a hypothesis that a vacuum pump could be made, and proved this by making one. In 1656 Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke used this information and built an air pump. Over the next 150 years the theory was expanded on and improved. Denis Papin built a steam pressuriser and release valve, and designed a piston cylinder and engine, which Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen built. These engines inspired the study of heat capacity and latent heat. Joseph Black and James Watt increased the steam engine efficiency and it was their work that Sadi Carnot (considered the father of thermodynamics) studied before publishing a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency in 1824. This work by Carnot was the beginning of modern thermodynamics as a science, with the first thermodynamics textbook written in 1859, and the first and second laws of thermodynamics being determined in the 1850s. Scientists such as Lord Kelvin, Max Planck, J. Willard Gibbs (all names you should recognise) among many many others studied thermodynamics. Over the course of 350 years thermodynamics has developed from the building of a vacuum pump, to some of the most important fundamental laws of energy.\n",

            " Case study: Breathalysers Read the following extract taken from HowStuffWorks (12/08/13): The Breathalyzer device contains: A system to sample the breath of the suspect Two glass vials containing the chemical reaction mixture A system of photocells connected to a meter to measure the color change associated with the chemical reaction To measure alcohol, a suspect breathes into the device. The breath sample is bubbled in one vial through a mixture of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, silver nitrate and water. The principle of the measurement is based on the following chemical reaction: 2K2Cr2O7(aq) + 3CH3CH2OH(aq) + 8H2SO4(aq) 2Cr2(SO4)3(aq) + 2K2SO4 + 3CH3COOH(aq) + 11H2O(f) In this reaction: 1. The sulfuric acid removes the alcohol from the air into a liquid solution. 2. The alcohol reacts with potassium dichromate to produce: chromium sulfate, potassium sulfate, acetic acid, water The silver nitrate is a catalyst, a substance that makes a reaction go faster without participating in it. The sulfuric acid, in addition to removing the alcohol from the air, also might provide the acidic condition needed for this reaction. During this reaction, the reddish-orange dichromate ion changes color to the green chromium ion when it reacts with the alcohol; the degree of the color change is directly related to the level of alcohol in the expelled air. To determine the amount of alcohol in that air, the reacted mixture is compared to a vial of unreacted mixture in the photocell system, which produces an electric current that causes the needle in the meter to move from its resting place. The operator then rotates a knob to bring the needle back to the resting place and reads the level of alcohol from the knob the more the operator must turn the knob to return it to rest, the greater the level of alcohol. Break into groups of three or four. Research breathalysers and then report your information to the class. Make sure to cover the following areas: The effect of alcohol on the body The effect of alcohol on reaction times The origins of the breathalyser The term mouth alcohol and its effect on breathalyser tests.\n",
