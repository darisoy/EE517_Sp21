If a theory is found to have been incorrect it is changed to fit this new information.

Although this changing of opinion is often taken for inconsistency, it is this very willingness to adapt that makes science useful, and allows new discoveries to be made. Remember that the term theory has a different meaning in science. A scientific theory is not like your theory of about why you can only ever find one sock. A scientific theory is one that has been tested and proven through repeated experiment and data.

The basis for these three rules started as far back as 1650 with Otto von Guericke. He had a hypothesis that a vacuum pump could be made, and proved this by making one. In 1656 Robert Boyle and Robert Hooke used this information and built an air pump. Over the next 150 years the theory was expanded on and improved. Denis Papin built a steam pressuriser and release valve, and designed a piston cylinder and engine, which Thomas Savery and Thomas Newcomen built. These engines inspired the study of heat capacity and latent heat. Joseph Black and James Watt increased the steam engine efficiency and it was their work that Sadi Carnot (considered the father of thermodynamics) studied before publishing a discourse on heat, power, energy and engine efficiency in 1824. This work by Carnot was the beginning of modern thermodynamics as a science, with the first thermodynamics textbook written in 1859, and the first and second laws of thermodynamics being determined in the 1850s. Scientists such as Lord Kelvin, Max Planck, J. Willard Gibbs (all names you should recognise) among many many others studied thermodynamics. Over the course of 350 years thermodynamics has developed from the building of a vacuum pump, to some of the most important fundamental laws of energy.\n",

Using the scientific method there is no limit as to what we can investigate. The scientific method can be summarised as follows: 1. Ask a question about the world around you. 2. Do background research on your questions. 3. Make a hypothesis about the event that gives a sensible result. You must be able to test your hypothesis through experiment. 4. Design an experiment to test the hypothesis. These methods must be repeatable and follow a logical approach. 5. Collect data accurately and interpret the data. You must be able to take measurements, collect information, and present your data in a useful format (drawings, explanations, tables and graphs). 6. Draw conclusions from the results of the experiment. Your observations must be made objectively, never force the data to fit your hypothesis. 7. Decide whether your hypothesis explains the data collected accurately. 8. If the data fits your hypothesis, verify your results by repeating the experiment or getting someone else to repeat the experiment. 9. If your data does not fit your hypothesis perform more background research and FACT In science we never 'prove' a hypothesis through a single experiment because there is a chance that you made an error somewhere along the way.

The model should be able to explain as many observations of the large system as possible, and yet be relatively simple. An example of a model was the spherical model of the Earth, rather than a flat one. Many educated people of the day (in the late 1400s) knew that the Earth could not be flat due to observations that did not fit. A spherical Earth model was proposed, which was testable on a small scale. The model explained many previously unexplained phenomenon (such as that ships appeared to sink over the horizon, regardless of the direction of travel). The model was further verified by the shape of the Earth's shadow on the moon during lunar eclipses.\n",

Remember to face the mouth of the test tube away from you and members of your group when heating a test tube. Always check with your teacher how to dispose of waste.

In many cases, an object needs to be brought to rest from a certain initial velocity. This means there is a certain specified change in momentum. If the time during which the momentum changes can be increased then the force that must be applied will be less and so it will cause less damage.

Air bags extend the time required to stop the momentum of the driver and passenger. During a collision, the motion of the driver and passenger carries them towards the windshield. If they are stopped by a collision with the windshield, it would result in a large force exerted over a short time in order to bring them to a stop. If instead of hitting the windshield, the driver and passenger hit an air bag, then the time of the impact is increased. Increasing the time of the impact results in a decrease in the force. F = p Therefore if t is increased, for a constant change in momentum, force on body is reduced The same principle explains why wicket keepers in cricket use padded gloves or why there are padded mats in gymnastics.

When cars bounce off each other, or rebound, there is a larger change in momentum and therefore a larger impulse. A larger impulse means that a greater force is experienced by the occupants of the cars. When cars crumple together, there is a smaller change in momentum and therefore a smaller impulse. The smaller impulse means that the occupants of the cars experience a smaller force. Car manufacturers use this idea and design crumple zones into cars, such that the car has a greater chance of crumpling than rebounding in a collision. Also, when the car crumples, the change in the car's momentum happens over a longer time.

We now study the motion of objects that are moving upwards or downwards while experiencing a force due to gravity. We call this projectile motion.

In vertical projectile motion we deal with objects that fall under the influence of gravity and only vertically. Objects that move up and down (vertical projectiles) on the Earth accelerate with a constant acceleration --g which is approximately equal to 9,8 ms 2directed downwards towards the centre of the earth. The time it takes an object to rise to its maximum height, is the same as the time it will take to fall back to its initial height. The magnitude of the velocity will also be the same but the direction will be reversed. This is known as time symmetry and is a consequence of uniform gravitational acceleration. The equations of motion can be used to solve vertical projectile problems. --vf = --vi + --gt --x = (--vi + --vf ) t --1-2 x = vi t + 2 gt --v2 = --v2 + 2--g--x Graphs for vertical projectile motion are similar to graphs for motion at constant acceleration.\n",

The breath sample is bubbled in one vial through a mixture of sulfuric acid, potassium dichromate, silver nitrate and water. The principle of the measurement is based on the following chemical reaction: 2K2Cr2O7(aq) + 3CH3CH2OH(aq) + 8H2SO4(aq) 2Cr2(SO4)3(aq) + 2K2SO4 + 3CH3COOH(aq) + 11H2O(f) In this reaction: 1. The sulfuric acid removes the alcohol from the air into a liquid solution. 2. The alcohol reacts with potassium dichromate to produce: chromium sulfate, potassium sulfate, acetic acid, water The silver nitrate is a catalyst, a substance that makes a reaction go faster without participating in it. The sulfuric acid, in addition to removing the alcohol from the air, also might provide the acidic condition needed for this reaction. During this reaction, the reddish-orange dichromate ion changes color to the green chromium ion when it reacts with the alcohol; the degree of the color change is directly related to the level of alcohol in the expelled air. To determine the amount of alcohol in that air, the reacted mixture is compared to a vial of unreacted mixture in the photocell system, which produces an electric current that causes the needle in the meter to move from its resting place. The operator then rotates a knob to bring the needle back to the resting place and reads the level of alcohol from the knob the more the operator must turn the knob to return it to rest, the greater the level of alcohol. Break into groups of three or four. Research breathalysers and then report your information to the class.

When naming organic compounds, the IUPAC (International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry) nomenclature (naming scheme) is used. This is to give consistency to the names. It also enables every compound to have a unique name, which is not possible with the common names used (for example in industry). We will first look at some of the steps Molecules can contain both double or triple bonds and other functional groups ( an alkene and an alcohol functional group in one molecule propenol). However, all molecules explored in this book will contain only single carbon-carbon bonds when combined with that need to be followed when naming a compound, and then try to apply these rules to some specific examples. A good general rule to follow is to start at the end (the suffix) and work backwards (from right to left) in the name.\n",

You should remember from the kinetic theory of matter (see Grade 10), that the phase of a substance is determined by how strong the forces are between its particles. The weaker the forces, the more likely the substance is to exist as a gas. This is because the particles are able to move far apart since they are not held together very strongly. If the forces are very strong, the particles are held closely together in a solid structure. Remember also that the temperature of a material affects the energy of its particles. The more energy the particles have, the more likely they are to be able to overcome the forces that are holding them together. This can cause a change in phase.\n",

The molecule will have a temporary dipole. When this happens, molecules that are next to each other attract each other very weakly. Dipole-induced-dipole forces These forces exist between dipoles and non-polar molecules. The dipole induces a dipole in the non-polar molecule leading to a weak, short lived force which holds the compounds together.

Addition reactions occur with unsaturated compounds. The general equation for an addition reaction: A + B C Notice that C is the final product with no A or B remaining as a residue. An elimination reaction occurs when a reactant is broken up into two products. Elimination reactions occur with saturated compounds. The general equation for an elimination reaction: A B + C A substitution reaction occurs when an exchange of elements in the reactants takes place.
